Your Opinion Needed – Quick & Anonymous!

Hey Team,

Let’s be real—how often do you actually read our quarterly newsletter?
Do you love it? Scroll past it? Open it just to mark it as read? 🤔

We promise we won’t take it personally (mainly because this survey is 100% anonymous!). We just want to know if the newsletter is something you enjoy or if it’s time to shake things up.

🔍 Why should you take 2 minutes to fill this out?
✔ If you love the newsletter, we’ll keep it going!
✔ If you don’t, we’ll rethink it (or maybe send fewer emails—win-win?).
✔ If you’re neutral, at least clicking the link will make us feel better.

Your feedback matters, and no one will know what you say—so be honest!
