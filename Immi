Dear South Australia Immigration,

I am writing to inquire about my Expression of Interest (EOI) for the South Australian Skilled Nominated Visa (Subclass 190). My EOI was flagged for inclusion during last year's rounds, but I was not invited to apply for a nomination.

I am eager to migrate to South Australia and contribute to your community. I have [number] years of experience in [occupation], and I am confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset. I have also met all of the eligibility requirements for the Subclass 190 visa.

I understand that there are no guarantees regarding invitations, but I would be grateful if you could provide me with any information about when I can expect to be invited to apply for a nomination. I am also interested in learning more about any steps that I can take to improve my chances of being invited.
