Subject: Upcoming Migration to Jira/Zephyr for Test Management

Dear Team,

As you're aware, we are transitioning our test management activities to Jira/Zephyr, and some of our projects are already utilizing this platform. In line with this, we are targeting to complete the migration from ALM to Jira/Zephyr by October 2025, ensuring all test management activities are fully transitioned.

In preparation for this migration, we request that for any new projects or upcoming items, please confirm with your respective technology teams that they are aware of and aligned with this transition plan. This confirmation should be obtained before planning activities begin.

Once confirmed, the technology teams should get in touch with Rekha/Dhamodar for further guidance and support on the migration process.

This will ensure a smooth transition and enable us to adapt to the new toolset.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll provide more information and training on the migration process in the coming months.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
