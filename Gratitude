Here's a revised version:

"I'm grateful for Anba R's exceptional support and expertise in developing complex SQL queries for three critical HRPT red flags during Cards Phase 2 UAT. With minimal initial guidance from me, he quickly grasped the requirements and nuances of EAP, and independently developed high-quality queries. Impressively, he accommodated this task amidst his existing UAT commitments, ensuring timely delivery without compromising on quality. By taking ownership of a significant portion of the workload, he shared my burden and ensured efficient completion.

Thank you, Anba R, for your ability to rapidly understand the needs, work independently, accommodate this task amidst your other priorities, and deliver high-quality results. Your collaboration and support made a significant impact, and I appreciate your teamwork!"
