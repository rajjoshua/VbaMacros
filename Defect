Subject: Request for UAT End Date Extension due to Ongoing Technical Defect

Dear PMO Team,

I am writing to request an extension of the UAT end date for the Next-Gen Release Testing project. Our team encountered a critical technical defect on [defect identification date] that has halted progress.

The technology team is currently working on resolving the defect, but an estimated resolution date is yet to be confirmed. To ensure thorough testing and maintain quality standards, we require an extension of the UAT end date.

We propose revising the UAT timeline once the defect is resolved. We estimate needing [number] additional working days from the defect resolution date to complete testing.

Request details:

- Original UAT end date: [original end date]
- Defect identification date: [defect identification date]
- Estimated additional days required: [number] working days

We will provide an updated estimate once the defect resolution date is confirmed. We appreciate your understanding and flexibility in this matter.

Thank you for considering our request.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
UAT Team
