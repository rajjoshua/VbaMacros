Gate Gully Cricket: A Growing Tradition

Within our office's test automation team, a small group of cricket enthusiasts decided to bring a refreshing change to our routines. This led to the formation of "Gate Gully Cricket," a name that perfectly captures the essence of our informal, yet spirited, cricket matches.

We began with just six members, playing every Saturday morning at KL Sentul from 7 to 11 AM. Over time, our team has grown to over 12 members, including friends and colleagues from other departments. One of our most enthusiastic players is a 10-year-old boy, whose energy adds a special charm to our matches.

The expansion of our team prompted us to move our games to an indoor turf, providing a consistent and comfortable playing environment. Each Saturday, we gather, ready to play and share laughs, building camaraderie and taking a break from our work routines.

What started as a small initiative has now become a highlight of our week, offering a great balance between work and leisure. The indoor setting has also allowed us to play regardless of the weather, ensuring that our Saturday tradition remains uninterrupted. The joy of playing cricket, coupled with the strengthening of relationships among team members and friends, has made Gate Gully Cricket a cherished part of our lives.

Gate Gully Cricket has become a cherished part of our weekly routine, bringing joy and excitement to everyone involved. As we continue to grow, we look forward to welcoming more participants and creating even more enjoyable moments on the field. Here's to many more Saturdays of cricket and camaraderie!
