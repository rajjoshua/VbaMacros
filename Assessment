Subject: Reminder: Identify Automation Opportunities before UAT
Hi team,
This is a friendly reminder to reach out to the automation team before commencing any User Acceptance Testing (UAT). By collaborating early, we can:
 * Identify potential test cases for automation: The automation team can assess your test cases and determine if they can be automated, saving time and resources during future UAT cycles.
 * Improve overall test coverage: By combining manual and automated testing, we can ensure comprehensive test coverage and identify any gaps in our testing strategy.
Please connect with the automation team as soon as you receive confirmation for a UAT cycle and provide the following information to help them assess automation feasibility:
 * Nature of testing: UI or data testing?
 * Data extraction method: Extracted data in Excel or direct DB connection?
 * Existing automation tool (if any):  If you're aware of a relevant tool, please mention the name.
 * Complexity assessment: If you believe manual testing is sufficient due to low complexity, please explain your reasoning.
 * Highly complex scenarios: If you encounter a scenario that seems highly complex and lacks existing automation tools, please request an immediate meeting with the automation team well ahead of UAT.
Thank you for your cooperation!
Best regards,
[Your Name]
